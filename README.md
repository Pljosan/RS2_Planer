## What can I do with Advanced planer?

Advanced planer is a web app that allows you to manage your life! At any time and from any device, you can log in and have your profile at your fingertips. 

:calendar: Advanced planer lets you create both private and public events, as well as see people attending your public events. Want to attach files to your task or event? Now you can!

:file_folder: When you register, we create a folder for you on our server. You can create new subfolders, upload, download, move, copy and delete files. Once a file is in your folder, you can attach it to any of your tasks.

:barber: Speaking of registering, apart from registering with your email address, you can also skip that step and login with either your Google or your Facebook profile! It's easier and you lose nothing if you opt out for this option. We don't ask for many permissions - only your email address.

:link: Have any pages you want tracked for changes? Waiting for results? Want to be the first one to apply for a job? We got you covered! Our link monitor will track any number of URIs you choose. 

:closed_lock_with_key: We encrypt all your data when we store it. We value security and your profile is safe with us.
